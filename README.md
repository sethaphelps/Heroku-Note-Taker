# Heroku Note Taker 

## Description

For this assignment I needed to create a note taking application. In this application notes are given a title and a description is added as well. The note is saved and can be clicked on to view again. If the user chooses, they can delete the note as well using the delete button on the page. To view this application the Heroku deployment link can be clicked. 

## Webpage

Attached is a link to the deployed webpage.
